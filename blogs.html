            <h2> Learn HTML with Arjun!</h2>
            <p>HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the standard language for creating webpages. It provides a way to structure content on the web and serves as the foundation for most websites. HTML is essential for defining the elements on a page, such as text, images, links, and interactive forms. It works by using a system of tags, which the browser reads to display content correctly.<br>
            [1.] History and Purpose of HTML ---
            HTML was created by Tim Berners-Lee in the early 1990s to help researchers share information on the web. Since then, HTML has evolved, and the latest version, HTML5, introduces new tags and capabilities that make it easier to build modern, interactive, 
            and multimedia-rich webpages.<br>
            [2.] HTML Tags and Elements ---
            HTML is built with tags, which enclose the content and tell the browser how to display it. Tags usually come in pairs, with an opening tag and a closing tag.<br>
            [3.] HTML Attributes ---
            Attributes provide additional information about an element. They are included in the opening tag of an element and are written as name-value pairs. Common attributes include:

            <h2> Learn CSS with Arjun!</h2>
            <p>CSS, or Cascading Style Sheets, offers a flexible way to style web content, with styles originating from browser defaults, user preferences, or web designers. These styles can be applied inline, within an HTML document, or through external .css files for broader consistency. Not only does this simplify web development by promoting reusability and maintainability, it also improves site performance because styles can be offloaded into dedicated .css files that browsers can cache. Additionally, even if the styles cannot be loaded or are disabled, this separation maintains the accessibility and readability of the content, ensuring that the site is usable for all users, including those with disabilities. Its multi-faceted approach, including considerations for selector specificity, rule order, and media types, ensures that websites are visually coherent and adaptive across different devices and user needs, striking a balance between design intent and user accessibility.</p>

            <h2> Learn JAVASCRIPT with Arjun!</h2>
            <p>The initial versions of the scripting language were for internal use only. After Netscape submitted it to ECMA International as a standard specification for web browsers, JavaScript pioneered the release of ECMAScript.<br>
                It was a general-purpose scripting language to ensure web pages’ interoperability across different browsers and devices.
                JavaScript has continued to grow alongside new browsers like Mozilla Firefox and Google Chrome since then. The latter even started developing the first modern JavaScript engine, called V8, which compiles bytecode into native machine code.
                Today, JavaScript has plenty of frameworks and libraries to simplify complex projects, such as AngularJS, jQuery, and ReactJS.<br>
                Originally run on the client-side, the JavaScript implementation has branched out to the server-side after the Node.js development ‒ a cross-platform server environment built on the Google Chrome JavaScript V8 engine.
                While it caters to web-based programs the most, JavaScript programming features have other implementations in different areas. The following are several basic uses of JavaScript.</p>

            <h2> Learn PYTHON with Arjun!</h2>
            <p>What type of language is Python? Python is an interpreted, object-oriented, high-level programming language with dynamic semantics developed by Guido van Rossum. It was originally released in 1991. Designed to be easy as well as fun, the name "Python" is a nod to the British comedy group Monty Python. Python has a reputation as a beginner-friendly language, replacing Java as the most widely used introductory language because it handles much of the complexity for the user, allowing beginners to focus on fully grasping programming concepts rather than minute details.<br>
                Python is used for server-side web development, software development, mathematics, and system scripting, and is popular for Rapid Application Development and as a scripting or glue language to tie existing components because of its high-level, built-in data structures, dynamic typing, and dynamic binding. Program maintenance costs are reduced with Python due to the easily learned syntax and emphasis on readability. Additionally, Python's support of modules and packages facilitates modular programs and reuse of code. Python is an open source community language, so numerous independent programmers are continually building libraries and functionality for it.</p>
